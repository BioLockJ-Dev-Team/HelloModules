/**
 * Start with the basic documentation.  What are you aiming to do?  
 * You have to do this sooner or later, and its better to do it right out the gate.
 * 
 * In your simple module, add "implements ApiModule" like you see in this class.
 * You can copy/paste these methods into your own module, or use your IDE to add overriding methods.
 * For example, in Eclipse, right click in the class body > source > Override / Implement methods ...  
 * will open a window to let you select from a list of methods to insert based on the parent class / interfaces.
 * 
 * All of the methods in this step return String.  Even if you have never used java before, you can see where you need to fill in your own text.

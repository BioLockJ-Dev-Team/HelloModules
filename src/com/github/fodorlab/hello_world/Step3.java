/**
 * Even a very simple module probably uses at least one property. Properties are key/value pairs given in the config
 * file that control what a module does. Its really important to document those!
 * 
 * You could just write it all out in your getDetails() method. However is much better to take the time to describe your
 * properties through these ApiModule methods. These methods allow the BioLockJ automated documentation process to
 * generate uniformly formated documentation for all modules, and allows users and GUIs to interact with your module via
 * the command line.
 * 
 * There are many properties that your module uses that you have nothing to do with. They are used in methods that
 * are inherited from the parent classes that handle most of the baseline module mechanics. You cover those when you
 * reference super().
